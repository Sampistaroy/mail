  * Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed;
    each script indicates a particular series of steps that can
    "upgrade" a target database to a new version, and optionally a
    series of steps that can "downgrade" similarly, doing the same
    steps in reverse.
  * Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.

Package: apt-cacher-ng
Description-md5: b88e5e2d04c76e8d4500fb60880c7d76
Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using libraw, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

 Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a PC-type
 disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is damaged, incorrect or
 deleted.
 .
 It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and sizes of
 inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical. It gives you the
 information you need to manually re-create them (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk,
 etc.).
 .
 The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly believe the
 guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk device.
 .
 Currently supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:
 .
  * BeOS filesystem type.
  * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning scheme used on Intel
    platforms.
  * Linux second extended filesystem.
  * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 "filesystems".
  * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.
  * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).
  * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).
  * The Minix operating system filesystem type.
  * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.
  * QNX 4.x filesystem.
  * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X > 11).
  * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning scheme on PC hard
    disks similar to the BSD disklabels.
  * Silicon Graphics' journalling filesystem for Linux.
 .
 Gpart is useful in recovery actions and forensics investigations.

Package: gpsprune
Description-md5: 4cd2b69a33c05e4615249da27b877da9
Description-en: visualize, edit, convert and prune GPS data
 GpsPrune is an application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate
 data from GPS systems. It's a tool for preparing GPS data before you go on a
 trip, and for playing with your collected GPS data after you get home again.
 .
 It can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any
 tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS
 receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap
 images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete
 points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data
 (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX
 file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS
 receiver.
 .
 Some example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting
 wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It
 can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from
 various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to
 analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.
 .
 Furthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and
 lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions.
 You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a
 nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or
 speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the
 EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that
 they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have
 coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or
 automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write
 these coordinates into the EXIF tags.

Package: python-gabbi
Description-md5: d61b4fcb2fe54cb7bc1860d8d564512a
Description-en: declarative HTTP testing library - Python 2.x
 Gabbi is a tool for running HTTP tests where requests and responses are
 represented in a declarative form.
 .
 Gabbi works to bridge the gap between human readable YAML files that represent
 HTTP requests and expected responses and the obscured realm of Python-based,
 object-oriented unit tests in the style of the unittest module and its
 derivatives.
 .
 Each YAML file represents an ordered list of HTTP requests along with the
 expected responses. This allows a single file to represent a process in the
 API being tested. For example:
 .
  * Create a resource.
  * Retrieve a resource.
  * Delete a resource.
  * Retrieve a resource again to confirm it is gone.
 .
 At the same time it is still possible to ask gabbi to run just one request.
 If it is in a sequence of tests, those tests prior to it in the YAML file will
 be run (in order). In any single process any test will only be run once.
 Concurrency is handled such that one file runs in one process.
 .
 These features mean that it is possible to create tests that are useful for
 both humans (as tools for improving and developing APIs) and automated CI
 systems.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.

Description-en: XStatic base package with minimal support code - Python 2.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

Description-md5: 342347c893d12ea824d7abbc4b1fd284
Description-en: Angular JS Mock XStatic support - Python 2.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.

 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.
